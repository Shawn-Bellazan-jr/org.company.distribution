# Aspire Solution MVP

This repository contains the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the Aspire Solution, designed to quickly deliver AI-driven CRUD operations using 
.NET with Semantic Kernel and OpenAI integrations. This MVP is focused on speed-to-market with a streamlined approach, allowing rapid revenue
generation while maintaining the foundation for scalability.

## Project Structure

```
/AspireSolution
    /src
        /Core                         
            /Entities                   # Only essential entities (e.g., Lead, Customer)
            /Interfaces                 # Core abstractions for CRUD operations
            /Specifications             # Minimal validation and business logic

        /Application                     
            /UseCases                   # Specific, revenue-driving use cases only
            /Services                   # Core service handling CRUD tasks with AI
            /DTOs                       # Essential data transfer objects

        /Infrastructure                  
            /Persistence                # One primary database instance setup
            /AI                         # Semantic Kernel integration, with focus on prompt-driven CRUD
            
        /Presentation
            /Example.API                # Web API for CRUD endpoints
            /Client                     # Basic Blazor app for client interactions
```

## Key Features

1. **AI-Powered CRUD Operations**: The Semantic Kernel is used to control CRUD actions based on predefined prompts, automating core business tasks.
2. **Simplified Database "Brain"**: One core database instance handles the main business logic, allowing fast and efficient data management.
3. **Blazor Client for Interactions**: A simple client-side Blazor app allows users to interact with the system.
4. **Focused Use Cases**: The application is streamlined to focus on tasks directly contributing to revenue generation, such as lead management and customer data handling.

## Deployment

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have .NET, Docker, and necessary dependencies.
2. **Run the API**: Use Docker or local .NET CLI to run the API and Blazor app.
3. **Configure AI Services**: Make sure your OpenAI API key and Semantic Kernel settings are configured properly.

```bash
# Example commands to run the project locally
dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotnet run --project /src/Presentation/Example.API
```

## Next Steps

Once the MVP is operational, the system can be expanded by:
- Adding modular AI "brains" for different data domains.
- Extending CRUD capabilities with more dynamic prompts.
- Implementing additional AI services and automation scripts.
